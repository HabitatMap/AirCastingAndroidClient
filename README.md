## AirCasting - Share your Air!

### About

This is the android app for the AirCasting project - the project aims to build a platform for gathering, visualization and sharing of environmental data. To learn more about the platform visit [aircasting.org](http://aircasting.org).

### Contribute

Unfortunately due to the fact that AirCasting is working on Google Maps v1, without a previously generated v1 API key you will not be able to run the project. We are planing to switch to Google Maps v2 in the future. If you do have the v1 API key, put it into `res/values/api_keys.xml`, import the project into Android Studio and build with Gradle.
